## what is react 
-React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, 
especially for single-page applications. 
-It was initially released on May 29, 2013.
-React was created by Facebook. React makes creating UI components very easy. 
-In React, you don't directly manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model). React uses something called a virtual DOM to handle any updates.
-When something changes in your app, React only updates the specific part of the page that needs it, instead of reloading everything. This makes your app run faster.
